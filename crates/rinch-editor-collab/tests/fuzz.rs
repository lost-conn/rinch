//! Seeded, deterministic fuzz/property tests for the collab adapter.
//!
//! Two invariants are stress-tested over thousands of random edits, spanning both
//! flat text-blocks and list containers (nested to depth 3 in practice):
//!
//! 1. **`model ≡ project(model)`** — after EVERY local edit, the CRDT must read
//!    back (`projected_doc`) as *exactly* the editor model that produced it. This is
//!    the load-bearing invariant of the whole design (a `project_change` bug shows up
//!    here as a model/CRDT mismatch on some random edit).
//! 2. **Convergence** — N peers make concurrent random edits and relay their
//!    incremental deltas (interleaved, FIFO so a change's deps always precede it).
//!    Once every peer has seen every delta, all peers must project to the *identical*
//!    document. This is the exact incremental-delta path pimble / `EditorHandle` use.
//!
//! A trial is **replayable bit-for-bit** from its `(seed, peers, rounds)` triple
//! (issue #214). Two things have to be pinned for that, not one. The **edit script**
//! comes from a fixed-seed xorshift PRNG, which was always deterministic. The **client
//! ids** were not: yrs breaks concurrent-insert ties by client id and `CollabDoc::blank`
//! takes yrs's default *random* one, so the converged document differed run to run — and
//! because later random positions are computed from that document, so did the edit count
//! (measured: the same binary at the same seeds reached four different outcomes in four
//! runs). Every session here is therefore built through
//! [`rinch_editor_collab::testing::session_with_client_id`] with an id derived from the
//! trial's own seed, so a failure reproduces exactly. `replaying_a_trial_is_byte_identical`
//! pins that property.
//!
//! The seam is test-only (behind this crate's `test-util` feature) on purpose: two live
//! peers sharing a client id corrupt the shared document, so production keeps the random
//! ids.
