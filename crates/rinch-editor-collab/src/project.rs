//! Local projection: fold a model [`Transaction`] into the CRDT.
//!
//! This is the **local** half of the `model ≡ project(model)` invariant. Rather than
//! pattern-matching each `Step`'s geometry (brittle for split/join), we project the
//! transaction's *net* effect (`before → after`) as a **block-list diff**:
//!
//! 1. The unchanged leading/trailing blocks are skipped by **`Rc` identity**
//!    ([`Node::same_ref`]) — the persistent model shares every untouched block, so
//!    typing one character reads and re-splices exactly one block.
//! 2. Each changed block is reconciled in place (`reconcile_node`) with a minimal
//!    common-prefix/suffix text splice, so the per-character CRDT identity of
//!    unchanged text survives and concurrent edits merge.
//! 3. The net block-count difference is inserted/deleted at the boundary, preserving
//!    the identity of the leading reconciled blocks (so a split keeps block N's text
//!    object and only *adds* the tail block).
//!
//! A changed top-level *list* reconciles recursively (same diff, one level down), so a
//! keystroke inside one list item re-splices only that item's text object. Any node
//! outside the supported scope (a non-list nested block, a table) anywhere in
//! `before` or `after` fails loud ([`CollabError::Unsupported`], design A22).
//!
//! The diff trusts `before` to describe what the CRDT holds — which is the invariant —
//! but it **verifies** that trust before writing (issue #194): the pre-pass checks the
//! model/CRDT block counts match and reads back every CRDT node the write phase will
//! read, so a mismatch in either direction — a stray CRDT block the model lacks, or a
//! model block the CRDT lacks — fails loud with the CRDT untouched, never a partial
//! commit and never a silent divergence. The **one** exception the diff handles itself:
//! a CRDT holding zero blocks (issue #192) has no model that mirrors it, so `before`
//! carries a starter paragraph the CRDT does not. That case skips the diff entirely and
//! inserts the whole of `after`.
