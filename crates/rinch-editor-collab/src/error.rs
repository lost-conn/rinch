//! [`CollabError`] — the one error type for the collab adapter.
//!
//! The most important variant is [`CollabError::Unsupported`]: per design amendment
//! **A22**, the staged first-milestone scope is **flat text-blocks + marks**, the list
//! containers, **leaf block atoms** (a block-level node with no content of its own,
//! such as `horizontal_rule`) and the **inline atoms** `image`/`hard_break`. When the
//! adapter meets a model shape it cannot faithfully project onto the CRDT (a nested
//! block outside that scope, a table, a multi-block paste it cannot reduce), it
//! **fails loud** with `Unsupported` rather than
//! silently dropping the change. A silent drop would reintroduce the exact "the two
//! sides disagree" divergence class the editor rewrite set out to kill.
