//! # rinch-editor-collab
//!
//! Optional, **opt-in** collaborative-editing adapter for the Rinch editor, and the
//! **only** first-party home of a CRDT engine — [`yrs`] (Yjs) — in the workspace
//! (design §2/§8, issue #190). Gated behind the facade's `collaboration` feature so
//! default builds — desktop *and* web — link zero CRDT code. The crate itself is pure
//! model↔CRDT logic with no platform deps and is **wasm-compatible with no shims**, so
//! a Rust web editor view can reuse this *same* adapter rather than bridging to a
//! separate JS CRDT.
//!
//! The CRDT is *not* the document model — `rinch-editor-core` is. This crate projects
//! that pure model onto a yrs CRDT so concurrent edits converge, and rebuilds remote
//! CRDT changes back into editor [`Step`](rinch_editor_core::Step)s. The whole design
//! rests on one invariant:
//!
//! > **`model ≡ project(model)`** — every local step is projected onto the CRDT
//! > ([`CollabDoc::project_change`]); every remote CRDT change is rebuilt into the model
//! > ([`CollabSession::integrate_incremental`]). Convergence then follows from yrs's own
//! > convergence.
//!
//! **The one exception**, scoped exactly: a CRDT holding **zero** content blocks
//! projects to the *starter-paragraph* model, because the editor schema admits no empty
//! document. The two documents are still equal — [`CollabDoc::to_doc`] supplies that
//! paragraph — but it is not backed by CRDT content, so it is the one block
//! [`CollabDoc::project_change`] must insert rather than reconcile. Zero blocks is a
//! reachable converged state (two peers concurrently deleting different blocks, issue
//! #192), and it is self-healing: the next local edit projects the model wholesale and a
//! fully-backed equality is restored.
//!
//! ## Staged scope (design A22)
//!
//! The first milestone covers **flat text-blocks + marks** (`paragraph`/`heading`/
//! `code_block` with text + bold/italic/link/… marks), the **list containers**
//! (`bullet_list`/`ordered_list`/`list_item`, nested to any depth), **leaf block
//! atoms** — a block-level node holding no content at all, such as the
//! `horizontal_rule` an author inserts as a scene break, which projects as a block
//! whose text is empty — and the **inline atoms** `image`/`hard_break`, each one
//! U+FFFC char of its block's text carrying a reserved `@atom` attribute. Anything
//! outside that — a nested block the containers do not cover, a table, a task list —
//! is [`CollabError::Unsupported`]: the adapter **fails loud** rather than silently
//! dropping a change, because a silent drop is exactly the divergence class the editor
//! rewrite set out to kill.
//!
//! ## Quick start
//!
//! ```
//! use std::rc::Rc;
//! use rinch_editor_core::{EditorState, Schema, Fragment, default_plugins};
//! use rinch_editor_collab::CollabSession;
//!
//! let schema = Rc::new(Schema::starter_kit());
//! let para = schema.branch("paragraph", Fragment::from_node(schema.text("hi").unwrap())).unwrap();
//! let doc = schema.branch("doc", Fragment::from_node(para)).unwrap();
//! let state = EditorState::create(schema.clone(), doc, default_plugins());
//!
//! // Peer A starts a session and shares a snapshot.
//! let a = CollabSession::new(&state).unwrap();
//! let b = CollabSession::from_bytes(&a.snapshot()).unwrap();
//! # let _ = (&a, &b, &state);
//! ```
